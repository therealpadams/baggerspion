            You've stumbled upon the blog of Paul Adams. Sorry about that. 
            I'm a broadly-experienced (read: "expert in nothing") engineering 
            leader based in Berlin. When I make the effort to write, I mostly 
            write about engineering topics I care about. Very ocasionally, 
            you might catch me writing about my life in Germany.
