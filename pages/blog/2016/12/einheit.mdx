I'm flying home for Chrismas. Literally, I am sat in a plane right
now. Being able to blog offline is one the side benefits of [my switch
in technology behind Baggerspion](/2016/12/new-baggerspion/). So far
it has been a pretty ordinary journey:

- Left home a little later than I should have
- Realised, en route, that I forgotten ato pack at least two things
  that I *really* need
- Deutsche Bahn deciding to stop all service on the SBahn only one
  stop before the airport...

## Cancelling The Train

I was already running late for my flight, so the Deutsche Bahn
interruption was really not appreciated. But what was I to do?

Having been unceremoniously deposited at Alt Glienicke, I headed to
the roadside an ordered a taxi. Given the time it would take for the
tai to arrive and the 10 minute it would take to the drive on to the
airport, I simply assumed I would not make my flight. Ryanair: not
exactly renowned for its flexibility and compassion for late-running
passengers.

Berlin is really a small city when it wants to be. Whilst waiting for
a taxi I realised I was standing right next to a friend of mine (who
had also been kicked off the train and was just standin in the
crowd). Somehow his taxi arrived very quickly compared with the one I
ordered. He offered to join in his taxi in order to get to the airport
quicker.

 animal*

Eventually, after a short taxi ride, some gratuitous queue-skipping
and a hugely uneventful security screening, I walk straight up to the
boarding queue and get straight onto the plane.

It really was an ordinary trip to the airport.

Schoenefeld, by the way. You know, the airport that is right next door
to that other airport that we cannot use because of the omnishmables
that is the project management of BER?

## Berlin Is Extraordindary

Two days ago there was an attack on Christmas Market here in
Berlin. By now, the thinking is that this was a deliberate act of
terrorism. At the time the police were very cautious about what they
were calling this event.

12 people died.

In the immediate aftermath you'd be forgiven for thinking that life in
Berlin would be somewhat subdued. Possibly even a little jittery or
nervous. But, if you *were* to think that, you obviously do not
understand Berliners very well.

### We Are Berlin?

Remember the bombings in London back in 2005? Remember the "We Are
London" t-shirts, bags and accessories that came out?  Don't hold your
breath for something similar in Berlin.

Well within living memory, Germany was a divided country and Berlin
was a very divided city. These days Berlin has grown to become
welcoming, resilient and totally unimpressed with your bullshit. It
*had* to.

I could not think of a worse target for a terrorist attack.

## Leaving On A Jet Plane

So now I am sitting in this flight having had time to reflect on what
happened two days ago. The papers this morning were all dominated by
the manhunt for the terrorist. As you might image, much of the
conversation with my friends over the last days has been dominated by
this one topic.

Keep holding your breath for those "We Are Berlin" t-shirts.

Today, two days later, really was a perfectly ordinary day. There was
no obvious increase of security at the airport. Berliners continue to
go about their lives in the way they want to live
them. Together. Quietly going about our business is the ultimate "fick
dich!" to anyone who would try to take this lifestyle away from us.

Today I am flying back to Scotland for Christmas. To my family. Now,
more than ever, I am conscious that this is no longer home.

The dirty, smelly, disfunctional, disorganised, beautiful, artistic,
creative mess that is Berlin... that's home. For all of us. And for
you, too. Because that lifesyle that are are very proud of in Berlin
is predicated on one thing: that only together can we make everyone
feel welcome.
