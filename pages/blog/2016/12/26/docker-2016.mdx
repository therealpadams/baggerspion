At this time of year I normally start making some basic analysis of
the ins-and-outs of some [KDE](http://www.kde.org) projects. This
year, to reflect upon some of the new technologies and communities I
have become part of, I am going to work with some other projects.

So let's take a look at [Docker](http://www.docker.com).

## In Case You Haven't Heard...

Docker is a technology for containerisation: building, deploying,
executing. Here it is [in their own
words](https://www.docker.com/what-docker):

> Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem
> that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools,
> system libraries â€“ anything that can be installed on a server. This
> guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of
> its environment.

By now Docker has grown to become a crucial set of technologies within
the containerisation ecosystem. So we might expect a strong community
to go along with that. Here are the blue blobs for 2016:

## Some Basic Observations

While a keen user of Docker, I'm hardly an active member of the
develop community (actually, not at all). So it is hard for me to be
insightful about what we are seeing here. That said, there are some
obvious observations to make:

- That is a huge number of contributors. Until I saw this visualisation, I'm really not sure what my expectation was. But the reality exceeds it, for sure. We're looking at 600+ contributors for 2016. Impressive.
- There is a decent core contributor community contributing throughout
  the year (I wonder how many of these contributors actual work for
  Docker) and recruitment through the year is sound, too. Not least of
  which, a handful of contributors who have clearly become very
  active.
- Retention is pretty bad. Just look at how white this visualisation
  is. The typical contributor commits during one week (I bet it is a
  single contribution on a single day) and then we never see them ever
  again.

This is clearly a strong showing from Docker in 2016. But, when we
scrape the surface, we see all the hallmarks of a community that is
growing faster than its management can handle. Almost without fail,
community management is something that is under-resourced. Now, I do
not know how big the community team at Docker is, but what I can see
is 100s of contributors who are motivated enough to take that first
step, but not motivated enough to stay. So if there is one thing the
Docker community should be focusing on in 2017, its increasing
retention of new contributors.

Congratulations to the Docker Community for its achievements in 2016
and best of luck for 2017!
