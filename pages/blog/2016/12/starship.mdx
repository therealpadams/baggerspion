Recently I have become addicted to the [coding challenges](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH)
of Daniel Shiffman on YouTube. The challenges are fun and his
presenting style is something to behold: just-under-control chaos. I
highly recomend them. Daniel is part of the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/) and a huge advocate for
the convergence of art and software.

## The Starfield Challenge

Daniel's first challenge was to create a starfield simulator within 10
minutes, using [Processing](https://www.processing.org). Daniel uses
Java for the purposes of the challenge and the video is inlcuded
below:

Simple enough: create a simulation of a first-person perspective of
travelling through stars. I decided to give this challenge a go since
my programming is more than a little rusty.

Just in Python, rather than Java.

The problem with Daniel's videos is that (for good or for bad) he sees
them through to the bitter end. So, whilst very entertaining, you are
presented the solution on a platter. IMO it would be better if there
was a video to introduce the problem (and perhaps provide some hints
for the approach) and a separate video with the solution.

So I followed Daniel's video and Java programming and came up with my
own Python solution. Needless to say, it should be very familiar to
anyone who watched the complete video:

```python
stars = []

def setup():
    global stars
    
    size(800, 800)
    stars = [Star() for x in range(800)]
    
def draw():
    background(0)
    translate(width / 2, height / 2)
    
    for star in stars:
        star.update()
        star.show()
        
class Star(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = random(-width, width)
        self.y = random(-height, height)
        self.z = random(width)
        self.pz = self.z
        
    def update(self):
        self.z -= 10
        if self.z < 1:
            self.__init__()
                
    def show(self):
        fill(255)
        noStroke()
        
        sx = map(self.x / self.z, 0, 1, 0, width)
        sy = map(self.y / self.z, 0, 1, 0, height)

        r = map(self.z, 0, width, 16, 0)        
        ellipse(sx, sy, r, r)
        
        px = map(self.x / self.pz, 0, 1, 0, width);
        py = map(self.y / self.pz, 0, 1, 0, height);
        
        self.pz = self.z
        
        stroke(255)
        line(px, py, sx, sy)
```

## On Processing

Processing is fun to use and simple enough to learn. Used carefully,
it could be a decent tool for helping to learn a new language
altogether. It is certainly a great tool for producing cool
visualisations.

If you are taking your first steps into data visualisation, you should
really look no further. If you are taking your first steps in
programming, it is a fun place to start but perhaps not the best.

Either way, I highly recommend downloading it and playing along with
Daniel's awesomely hyperactive videos!
