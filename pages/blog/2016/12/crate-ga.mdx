Last week CrateDB v1.0.1 was released as Generally Available. This is
the culmination of years of work, thousands of commits and in excess
of 1 million downloads.

To celebrate this release I wanted to take a moment to poke into the
contributions.

## Reminder: The Blue Blobs

It's been a long time since I wrote about a Blue Blobs visualisation
of a Git repo. So I thought I'd start with a small reminder:

- Each row represents one contributor to the repository
  - A real-life human being might have more than one row in the repo
- Each column of blue dots represents one week
- The darker the blue, the more activity (measured in commits) that
  week
- The dates shown represent the first and most recent commit times

The count of commits can be a useful metric for productivity. But
typically **not by itself**. So try and resist to make too many
judgements of what is going on inside a community when looking at
these pictures.

## Crate GA Blobs
So let's take a look at the Blue Blobs for the Crate GA release...
![Crate v1.0.1 Blobs](/assets/images/crate-ga-blobs.png)

I think this is pretty typical for a young-ish community:

- There's only a handful of regular contributors (and they are all
  getting paid to contribute)
- New contributor acquisition is slow
- The (slim) majority of contributors only make a few commits and then
  disappear

If your name appears on this diagram somewhere, congratulations and
thank you for your contrubutions to Crate v1.0.1.

With the first Crate GA release now made, it will be interesting to
see how this diagram changes over time. At the very least, I would
hope to see an increase in contributor acquisition.
