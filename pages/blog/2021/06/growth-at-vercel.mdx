## Recent History

I am very lucky in that I have never worked anywhere mediocre in my career. Every company I have worked for has been a pioneer in their field. My own role in those businesses has been varied: engineer, engineering manager, manager-of-managers, regional director, company director... and often a combination of the above.

Two things in common with all these roles. I was working with:

- Excellent people...
- ...challenging what was thought to be possible.

I learned a lot from all of these roles. A lot about engineering and engineers. About businesses and how they function. About leadership. About myself and what I like in my career.

My most-recent work has been particularly satisfying. These positions have been more like a "mini-CEO" than an engineering manager; I have been not just managing engineering managers, but also collaborating on product management, legal issues, accounting, employer branding, hiring, budget... At Scout24 I was also involved with acquisitions. This variety was a lot of fun and tied together by breadth of experience nicely.

Joining Vercel was a tough decision; I was having a lot of fun at Scout24. But Vercel was offering something special that, ultimately, was hard to say "No" to - the chance to lead their German subsidiary. This tied together all these things I had been enjoying recently, in the context of a Silicon Valley unicorn. Yes, plz.

## Vercel's Goals

On the back of [yesterday's anouncement](https://vercel.com/blog/series-c-102m-continue-building-the-next-web) Guillermo blogged his own thoughts on this milestone and took a moment to remind us all of Vercel's goals:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We <a href="https://twitter.com/vercel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vercel</a> just raised a $102M Series C @ 1.1B on our mission to help build a faster Web, made for everyone.<br/><br/>Our goals:<br/>1️⃣ Build the SDK for Web<br/>2️⃣ Lower the barrier of entry<br/>3️⃣ Focus on the end-user<a href="https://t.co/lRhHrjNFev">https://t.co/lRhHrjNFev</a></p>&mdash; Guillermo Rauch (@rauchg) <a href="https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1407716317507948549?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I thought I'd take a moment to talk a little about my thoughts on these and how they attracted me to Vercel.

### Build The SDK For Web

For me, the crucial word here is _"the"_. There is no interest here in being one of many. We want to be the first choice for moden web development. I am a huge fan of competition: it drives innovation and lowers costs, typically. In the front-end development space there is no shortage of options for building your modern web app. The Vercel platform supports many of them: Gatsby, Vue, Angular, Nuxt.js, React.

Of course, Vercel has its own framework: Next.js. Next is built on top of React; a highly powerful framework in its own right. However, where React focuses on components, Next adds additional abstraction to introduce the a page-based concept. Next.js, in the contest of the Vercel platform, is an incredibly powerful combination.

Ultimtely, it is through providing seamless integration between framework and platform that we will deliver on this goal.

### Lower The Barrier Of Entry

Vercel's products are designed to make life better for front-end developers. "Better" can be measured in a few ways, but at Vercel we focus on one specific metric: speed. We want to build a better web, faster.

With this in mind, developer experience is everything. After all, developers are the user. 

### Focus On The End-User
