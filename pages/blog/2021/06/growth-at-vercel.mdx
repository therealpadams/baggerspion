## Recent History

I am very lucky in that I have never worked anywhere mediocre in my career. Every company I have worked for has been a pioneer in their field. My own role in those businesses has been varied: engineer, engineering manager, manager-of-managers, regional director, company director... and often a combination of the above.

Two things in common with all these roles. I was working with:

- Excellent people...
- ...challenging what was thought to be possible.

I learned a lot from all of these roles. A lot about engineering and engineers. About businesses and how they function. About leadership. About myself and what I like in my career.
