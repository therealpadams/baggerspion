[Habitat
0.22.x](https://forums.habitat.sh/t/habitat-0-22-0-released/326) is
now in the wild and, with it, comes an all-new studio that
automatically loads a supervisor in the background. Sweet. But, also:
here be dragons.

## Studio And Supervisor: A Reminder

### Studio

Honestly, the [Habitat docs describe it
well](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/concepts-studio/)...

> The Habitat Studio is a clean, self-contained, minimal environment in
> which you can develop, build, and package software that is free from
> any upstream operating system distribution. All tools and dependencies
> included in the Studio are installed through Habitat packages, thus
> preventing any unwanted dependencies from being used by your package.

When I am working on a plan, I am not typically developing it inside
the studio. That is to say, I am not entering the studio and firing up
`emacs` to hack at my plan.sh or any hook scripts. Primarily, I view
it as the place I go to cleanly build and run my plan, while still
under development, without outside influence from that pesky host
operating system.

### Supervisor

More from [the
docs](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/concepts-supervisor/)...

> The supervisor is a process manager that has two primary
> responsibilities. First, it starts and monitors the child app service
> defined in the package. Second, it receives and acts upon
> configuration changes from other supervisors to which it is
> connected. A service will be reconfigured through hooks if its
> configuration has changed.

Notice that schtick about `receives and acts upon configuration
changes from other supervisors`? Supervisors can form "rings" in which
they gossip to each other, sharing pertinent information like "hey,
here's a config change that's just been applied". This enables
services deployed as groups to have their configs all updated
together.

Another important usage of supervisor (rings) is to provide support
for different deployment
[topologies](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/run-packages-topologies/). For
example, when your service supports the concept of a "master" and
"worker" nodes. I'll get back to this another time. For now, it is
enough to know these topologies exist.

Another important thing to note: it is not a one-to-one relationship
between supervisors and services. One supervisor can nurture many
services. And here is where my idiot's guide starts.

## So What's Up In 0.22?

So if it is not clear by now, the idiot in question is me.

When you enter a Habitat Studio in 0.22 you're going to be welcomed by
this cheery little message:

```bash
** The Habitat Supervisor has been started in the background.
** Use 'hab sup start' and 'hab sup stop' to start and stop services.
** Use the 'slog' command to stream the supervisor log.
** Adding 'NO_BG_SUP=1' to your .studiorc file will disable the background supervisor.
```

Having a supervisor launched immediately is a nice idea. You can get
to the business of loading, running and stopping as many services as
you'd like immediately. Which is exactly what I was doing quite
happily. Until I continued my work on [CrateDB](https://crate.io).

I'm not going to talk too much about what my CrateDB plan _does_. I'm
saving that until after I have showed it off at
[ChefConf](https://chefconf.chef.io).

### The Automatic Supervisor Trap

Well... here's how you would normally start a service using Habitat:
`hab start <origin>/<name>` or, in my case (because I am using a
topology): `hab start <origin>/<name> --topology leader`. These
commands instruct the supervisor to go and find the named package and
run it. Simple as that.

Or Is It?

When using the leader-follower topology you need to provide the
address of a peer supervisor to connect to: `hab start <origin>/<name>
--topology leader --peer some.supervisor.ip.address`

Notice the idiot mistake? It's kinda subtle. I hope you read those
docs I linked, otherwise you ain't got a chance of noticing.

The mistake comes in two related parts:

- `hab start` does not simply load your service, it starts a
  supervisor, too;
- `--topology` is an option to the service, `--peer` is an option to
  your new supervisor.

So that's the problem: 0.22 gives me a shiny studio with an
automatically-launched supervisor for convenience. But that supervisor
is not part of any ring. **When you launch a service using `hab
start... --peer` in studio in 0.22, you do not actually launch a new
supervisor, a ring is never formed and so your topology election never
completes!**

## The Remedy

This is easy enough. In fact the solution has been staring you in the face the whole time. Remember this?

```bash
** Adding 'NO_BG_SUP=1' to your .studiorc file will disable the background supervisor.
```

A simple `echo "NO_BG_SUP=1" >> .studiorc` inside the directory where
you start your studio will do the trick. Sadly, this reverts your
studio to pre-0.22 behaviour, but makes it much easier for you to test
topologies in the studio.
