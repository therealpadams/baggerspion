While at [ChefConf](https://chefconf.chef.io) I had another of my
now-infamous "how hard can it be?" moments. This time I was talking
about creating a `core/R` plan. As I am now accustomed to discovering,
the answer is not necesarilly "easy".

This blog post, however, is not necesarilly about
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the work to package it. Instead,
it is more about _how_ I am doing it.

## The R Project

For the uninitiated:

> R is a free software environment for statistical computing and
> graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms,
> Windows and MacOS.

I used R extensively during my PhD, mostly for performing my
statistical calculations. Any visualisation of that data was typically
being done inside [GnuPlot](http://www.gnuplot.info/), a tool which I
simply knew better.

Building R from source is not particularly troublesome for
Habitat. It's primary dependencies, with the exeception of
[Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/) are al available as core
packages. Building Cairo, a story for another day, is not necesarilly
trivial. In the case of Habitat, we also need to build,
[Harfbuzz](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/HarfBuzz/) and
[Pango](http://www.pango.org/) to make it work.

## The Pull Request

I always thought "Pull Request" was a funny name. To me it implies
"Hey, I'm done working on this thing. Please take it." I think they
are really a lot more powerful than this. Ultimately, the PR is
Github's mechanism for peer reivew and _that_ is what PR should really
stand for. Here is how Github describes them:

> Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a
> repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss
> and review the potential changes with collaborators and add
> follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the repository.

See that? "Discuss", "review"... collaborate! This is what PR's are
really for and, yet, it is incredible how rarely they are used this
way.

Take a look at my [core/R
PR](https://github.com/habitat-sh/core-plans/pull/571). My opening for
the request was as basic as it could be: "New core plan for R". This
is self explanatory and did not really need to state anything more
than that. My branch built, the unit tests passed and so did the build
tests on Travis. A good start. But was I done?

Clearly not. R provides a function for letting you know what that
installation of R is capable of. As someone who never used R's
graphical capabilities, it comes as no surprise that it is those
capabilities which were broken:

```bash
Interfaces supported:
External libraries:        readline, curl
Additional capabilities:   NLS
Options enabled:           shared BLAS, R profiling

Capabilities skipped:      PNG, JPEG, TIFF, cairo, ICU
Options not enabled:       memory profiling

Recommended packages:      yes
```

Adding most of the graphical capabilities simply requies
`core/libtiff`, `core/libpng` etc to be added to the packge
dependecies. That's easy enough to fix. Cairo, needs a new package and
so does some of its own dependencies.

More work.

Seeing that more work was on the horizon, I updaed my PR with a
comment to say what I ws working on. Despite my initial submission
technically working I decided it was better to continue with adding
the graphical stacks and I asked the PR to be marked "DO NOT MERGE".

I am now tag-teaming this work with [Steve
Danna](https://github.com/stevendanna) who is continuing to coordinate
his work and mine through conversation on the PR. For example, Steve
has opened his own PR to patch `core/pixmap` which is a change I will
need to merge to make my own PR work.

Steve and I have noticed a couple of quirks in the way pkg-config
works in Habitat. I'm not sure if this is bug or simply the way
`pkg_pconfig_dirs` has (not) been configured in various plans. I
suspect the latter.

Either way, Steve and I are pretty close to delivering `core/R` and
I'll write more about this then.
