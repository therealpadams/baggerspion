I've been living in Berlin for almost 3 years now. I am *very* overdue
to really start learning German. It's not that I don't speak *any*
German, but I got so far and then kinda took a step backwards, due to
lack of practice.

It's time to fix that.

I very much enjoy my life in Germany. But, if I am really to integrate
here, I've got to make the effort to learn the language.

## A Brief History Of Paul And Languages

- English is my native tongue. Most Germans of the same age as me
  speak/understand English better than I do.
- I learned French at school. I got good grades for learning French
  at school. But the standard is set comparatively low. On leaving
  school, I am positive my French was not as good as a German's
  English.
- I have learned all of my German organically. Picking up on things
  here and there. I have never had a real German lesson.

## My First German Lesson

This last point is important. My spread of knowledge stretches all the
way from A1 to B1. The problem is do not know *all* of A1 to B1. I
actually do not know all of any level between A1 and B1.

Example:

- I know that it is "Ich *bin* mit Fahrrad gefahren" and not "*habe*".
- I do not know what "I ate ice cream" is ("Ich aÃŸ Eis").

So today I had my first one-to-one German lesson. The focus was on
working out the gaps in my knowledge but also forcing me to speak
German; I do not do much of that day-to-day.

Towards the end of the lesson, my teacher had the best back-handed
compliment for me:

> For someone who knows so little German, you know an awful lot of
> German.

As my German lessons progress, I might occasionally write about how I
am progressing. For now, my focus is on getting A1 and A2 German
nailed, so that I can then join an intensive B1 course.
